The texts of the optional Consumer\r\nInformation Booklet and the mandatory form follow:\r\n			</p>\r\n		</li>\r\n	</ol>\r\n</p>\r\n<h1>A Consumer Information Booklet</h1>\r\n<h3>What Consumers Need to Know When Working with a Real Estate Broker</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	As real estate transactions have become more complex and varied, the\r\ntypes of real estate brokerage arrangements available to the public have\r\nevolved to meet the changing needs of consumers entering this market.\r\nThis booklet is intended to provide buyers and sellers with a description of\r\nthe different types of brokerage arrangements so that consumers can choose\r\nthe type of brokerage services best suited to their needs.\r\n</p>\r\n<h4>Know Your Rights</h4>\r\n<p>\r\n	At the initial contact between a licensee (both sales persons and brokers)\r\nand the public, the licensee shall be considered to be a transaction broker.\r\nAs soon as reasonably possible and before the exchange of confidential\r\ninformation, Alabama law requires the licensee to provide you with a\r\nwritten disclosure form that describes different types of brokerage arrangements.\r\nYou are encouraged to read and sign this disclosure form.\r\nAfter disclosure you may then choose the type of brokerage agreement\r\nbest suited to your needs. This brokerage agreement will contain a statement\r\nof the specific brokerage services the broker will provide. In the\r\nabsence of a signed brokerage agreement, the transaction brokerage relationship\r\nwill remain in effect. Make sure you talk to the real estate licensee\r\nwith whom you are working to determine the type of services you need or\r\nwill receive under alternative brokerage arrangements.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Customer or Client?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	The most important thing you need to know when working with a real\r\nestate licensee is whether you are a client or a customer. A licensee owes\r\ncertain duties to a client that are different from the services the licensee\r\nperforms for a customer.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Agent and Client</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	An agent is a person who acts for or represents you in negotiations with\r\nother parties. The client or principal is the person the agent represents. The\r\nlicensee when acting as an agent must loyally represent the best interest of\r\nthe client by placing the interests of the client ahead of the interests of any\r\nother party. In a real estate transaction, when a real estate salesperson is\r\nemployed as an agent, the salesperson is obligated to negotiate the best\r\nprice and terms for his or her client.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>What is a Customer?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	A customer is a person who is provided services by a real estate broker,\r\nbut who is not a client of the broker. In this case, the real estate licensee is\r\nnot acting as an agent. The actual services you receive from a real estate\r\nbroker depend on the arrangement that is established between you and the\r\nlicensee. The different types of real estate agreements are described below.\r\nThere are basically three types of real estate brokerage relationships that\r\ncan be established between the consumer and a real estate licensee: Single\r\nagency, limited consensual dual agency, and a transaction brokerage arrangement.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Transaction Brokerage</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	Transaction brokerage describes a brokerage arrangement whereby the\r\nreal estate licensee assists one or more parties, who are customers, in a\r\ncontemplated real estate transaction, without being the agent, fiduciary, or\r\nadvocate of that party to the transaction. This means that real estate\r\nbrokers and salespeople can act as intermediaries between buyers and\r\nsellers. With this type of brokerage arrangement, home buyers and sellers\r\nare customers and not clients of the licensees with whom they are working.\r\nThe basic function of the licensee is to bring buyers and sellers together so\r\nthat a real estate sale can be completed. Sellers will employ the licensee to\r\nhelp market their real estate by identifying qualified buyers and showing\r\ntheir properties to prospective purchasers. This will usually also involve\r\nadvertising properties for sale in newspapers and other media. Sellers will\r\ncommonly also rely on the expertise, experience, and advice of the real\r\nestate licensee to help make their property ready for sale and determine an\r\nappropriate asking price. Buyers, in turn, rely on the services of brokers to\r\nfind and show them suitable real estate that they can afford and have the\r\ndesired characteristics. Real estate professionals may also help consumers\r\nobtain mortgage financing as well as assist them with finalizing the real\r\nestate sale and recording the deed and other documents associated with the\r\nsale.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Transaction brokerage arrangements are usually best suited for consumers\r\nwho are primarily interested in the marketing services and expertise\r\nthat can be provided by real estate professionals, but who do not need an\r\nagent to represent them in the negotiations for the sale or purchase of real\r\nestate. Under transaction brokerage, the licensee must provide brokerage\r\nservices to all parties honestly and in good faith and avoid showing\r\nfavoritism to either buyer or seller. Alabama law also requires all licensees\r\nexercise reasonable care and skill when providing brokerage services, answer\r\nall questions completely and accurately, and present all written\r\npurchase offers to sellers promptly and in a truthful manner.\r\nLicensees must also keep confidential any information given to them in\r\nconfidence, unless disclosure of this information is required by law. For\r\nsellers, this means that licensees must answer a buyer\'s questions about the\r\ncondition of the property completely and honestly. In addition, the buyer\r\nmust be told about any hidden defects known to the licensee that could\r\naffect the health or safety of occupants.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Single Agency</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	A single agency arrangement describes a relationship whereby the real\r\nestate licensee represents only one party in a real estate sales transaction.\r\nIn the case of a single agency brokerage arrangement, the real estate\r\nlicensee represents either the buyer or the seller, but not both parties to the\r\nreal estate transaction. This type of brokerage arrangement is most appropriate\r\nfor consumers who need the advice and negotiating skills of real\r\nestate professionals in addition to their marketing services. If a seller enters\r\ninto a single agency agreement with a real estate broker, the broker is\r\nreferred to as a seller\'s agent. Under this arrangement the broker must\r\nrepresent only the seller in the negotiations with buyers. Here the broker\r\nwill seek the highest possible price and best possible sale terms for the\r\nseller. This type of brokerage arrangement can involve the use of subagents,\r\nespecially in situations where properties are marketed through a multiple\r\nlisting service.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Subagents are empowered to act for another broker in performing real\r\nestate services for that broker. The subagent owes the same duties to the\r\nbroker\'s client as the broker. If a broker is an agent of the seller, then the\r\nsubagent is also the seller\'s agent. When examining properties advertised\r\nthrough a multiple listing service it is important for buyers to determine\r\nwhether the licensee that is showing them properties is acting in the\r\ncapacity of a transaction broker, seller\'s agent or as a subagent of the seller.\r\nBuyers should exercise care with respect to the information they reveal to\r\nlicensees working as seller agents. For example, if you are the customer it\r\nwould not be wise to tell a licensee the maximum price you would be willing\r\nto pay for a particular property when considering making a formal purchase\r\noffer. If you are the customer, the broker\'s primary responsibility is to the\r\nseller. In this case, the licensee, as the seller\'s agent, must convey such\r\ninformation to the seller.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	A buyer\'s agent describes a real estate licensee who is employed by and\r\nrepresents only the buyer in a real estate transaction. This relationship is\r\ncreated by a written contract. This contract should clearly state the service\r\nthe agent will perform for the buyer as well as specify how the licensee is\r\npaid for services rendered in connection with the real estate sale. In this\r\ncase, the buyer is the client or principal and the real estate broker is the\r\nagent of and represents the buyer in dealings with sellers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	This type of real estate brokerage agreement should be used when the\r\nbuyer needs guidance and representation when negotiating with sellers to\r\npurchase real estate. Buyers moving to a new location and who are\r\nunfamiliar with local market conditions would be those consumers most\r\nlikely to benefit from this type of agency arrangement. It is becoming\r\nincreasingly common in multiple listing situations for the selling broker (a\r\nlicensee working with and showing properties to the buyer) to be an agent\r\nof the buyer and the listing broker to represent the owner-seller. Here, both\r\nthe buyer and seller, working through their respective agents, could negotiate\r\nat arm\'s length with the benefit of professional help.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Limited Consensual Dual Agent</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	Limited consensual dual agency is an agency relationship where the real\r\nestate brokerage company represents both the buyer and the seller in the\r\nsame real estate transaction. Consensual dual agency requires the licensee\r\nto obtain the written consent of both the buyer and the seller to act as their\r\nagent. The two most common circumstances where dual agency is encountered\r\nare:\r\n	<ol type=\"1\">\r\n		<li>\r\n			<p>\r\n			when two or more salespersons licensed under the same broker\r\neach represent a different party to the transaction, and \r\n			</p>\r\n		</li>\r\n		<li>\r\n			<p>\r\nwhen one licensee represents both the buyer and seller in the same sales transaction.\r\n			</p>\r\n		</li>\r\n	</ol>\r\nOne major advantage of limited consensual dual agency is that it allows\r\nbroader marketing opportunities than single agency arrangements. With\r\nthis type of contract, salespeople can show houses of owners that they\r\nrepresent as agents to their buyer clients. Consensual dual agency is\r\ncommon in the larger real estate markets where real estate companies often\r\nhave a large number of properties listed for sale. Many of these properties\r\nmay be desirable to their buyers. With a dual agency agreement, these\r\nproperties can be shown to their buyer clients.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the case of dual agency, the principle function of the licensee is to help\r\nboth parties reach mutually satisfactory outcome to their negotiations. The\r\ndual agent must avoid showing favoritism to either party and refrain from\r\nrevealing confidential information that could prove detrimental to one side\r\nor the other. Although buyers and sellers may not benefit from the full\r\nrange of services or agent loyalty that could otherwise be provided with a\r\nsingle agency arrangement, consensual dual agency does offer consumers\r\nmore assistance and guidance than would be possible under a transaction\r\nbrokerage arrangement.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	When considering signing a dual agency agreement, it is very important\r\nthat you talk with the broker to determine the types of services that will be\r\nprovided, and what types of information you will share with the broker and\r\nbroker\'s other clients.\r\n</p>\r\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	After reading this consumer information booklet, you should sign a\r\nbrokerage agreement that contains a statement of the services to be\r\nprovided by the real estate professional. Remember, if you do not sign a\r\nbrokerage agreement, by law, the licensee working with you will be considered\r\na transaction broker. Ask your real estate licensee to clarify and\r\nexplain anything in this booklet that you do not fully understand before\r\nsigning a contract for real estate brokerage services. You are encouraged to\r\nsign the disclosure form and retain a copy for your records.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	THIS IS FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES <br>\r\nTHIS IS NOT A CONTRACT <br>\r\nREAL ESTATE BROKERAGE SERVICES DISCLOSURE\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	*Alabama law requires you, the consumer, to be informed about the types of\r\nservices which real estate licensees may perform. The purpose of this disclosure\r\nis to give you a summary of these services.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA SINGLE AGENT is a licensee who represents only one party in a sale.\r\nThat is, a single agent represents his or her client. The client may be either\r\nthe seller or the buyer. A single agent must be completely loyal and faithful to\r\nthe client.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA SUBAGENT is another agent/licensee who also represents only one party\r\nin a sale. A subagent helps the agent represent the same client. The client\r\nmay be either the seller or the buyer. A subagent must also be completely\r\nloyal and faithful to the client.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA LIMITED CONSENSUAL DUAL AGENT is a licensee for both the buyer\r\nand the seller. This may only be done with the written, informed consent of\r\nall parties. This type of agent must also be loyal and faithful to the client,\r\nexcept where the duties owed to the clients conflict with one another.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA TRANSACTION BROKER assists one or more parties, who are customers,\r\nin a sale. A transaction broker is not an agent and does not perform the\r\nsame services as an agent.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	*Alabama law imposes the following obligations on all real estate licensees\r\nto all parties, no matter their relationship:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n	<li>\r\n		<p>\r\n			To provide services honestly and in good faith;\r\n		</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		<p>\r\n			To exercise reasonable care and skill;\r\n		</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		<p>\r\n			To keep confidential any information gained in confidence, unless\r\ndisclosure is required by law or duty to a client, the information becomes\r\npublic knowledge, or disclosure is authorized in writing;\r\n		</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		<p>\r\n			Present all written offers promptly to the seller;\r\n		</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		<p>\r\n			Answer your questions completely and accurately.\r\n		</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n	Further, even if you are working with a licensee who is not your agent, there\r\nare many things the licensee may do to assist you. Some examples are:\r\n</p>\r\n<ol type=\"1\">\r\n	<li>\r\n		<p>\r\n			Provide information about properties;\r\n		</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		<p>\r\n			Show properties;\r\n		</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		<p>\r\n			Assist in making a written offer;\r\n		</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		<p>\r\n			Provide information on financing.\r\n		</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n	You should choose which type of service you want from a licensee, and sign a\r\nbrokerage service agreement. If you do not sign an agreement, by law the\r\nlicensee working with you is a transaction broker.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe licensee\'s broker is required by law to have on file an office policy\r\ndescribing the company\'s brokerage services. You should feel free to ask any\r\nquestions you have.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe Alabama Real Estate Commission requires the real estate licensee to sign,\r\ndate, and provide you a copy of this form.
